Shell Lab


Project Description

The assignment consisted of the student to become familiar with Shells and how to create Shell scripts with Python. The lab assigned consisted of the creating a prompt in which the user is to be able to add a command along with its arguements, where the Shell is took take this input and be able to perform simple commands, background processes, and pipes. The shell was to be able redirect inputs and outputs and use all posix calls that were assigned for the Shell to perform.

This assignment was prepared in a manner consistent with the instructor's requirements. All significant collaboration or guidance from external sources is clearly documented.
Resources used:
* Used Dr. Freudenthal's source codes - (Used the Professor's source codes and used certain parts into my code, since they provided a better reference towards how the commands were used in Python. I implemented the use of the fork, execute, redirection and piping, whilst with the use of this, I was able to add the content that I needed in order to perform the tasks that were asked according to the assignment. I also used his testShell in order to test my own Python script to keep in awareness as to which mistakes I was making in my code.
    
* Used the following sites:
    *https://www.poftut.com/execute-shell-command-python/ - (Page was used in order to better understand the how to implement the parameters when using the Python Subprocess)
    *www.cs.uleth.ca/~holzmann/C/system/pipeforkexec.html - (Page was used in order to grasp a better understanding of the commands, but mostly for obtaining a better visual on how to implement the use of piping)
    *https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dup-dup2-linux-system-call/ - (I referenced from site, in order to know more about the use of the dup() and dup2() calls and how they're used concerning the file descriptors, which this provided me with a better visual)
    *www.sarathlakshman.com/2012/09/24/implementation-overview-of-redirection-and-pipe-operators-in-shell - (Used site to have a simpler understanding for each of the commands in shell; used the visuals as references on how to go about using redirection and piping.
