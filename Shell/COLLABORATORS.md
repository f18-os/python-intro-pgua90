The following describes people whom I collaborated with and what was collaborated on:

1.) Sebastian Nunez - My classmate assisted me with the Python Intro lab, in which he provided me with a better understanding towards the logic of Python, where I was able to learn through the discussion we had concerning the algorithm that would need to be implemented in order to accomplish every task that was asked acccording to the assignment. He explained how I could sort the words that I had found so that they may be displayed in a sorted fashion once the result was implemented into the output text file. For the Shell lab, my classmate explained the use of arguements and gave me an idea of how to implement these arguments, where with this idea I was able to produce the implementation of these arguments based on my understanding. I only assisted him in providing him the site of where the assignment requirements were located.

2.) Sergio Yanez - My classmate assisted me with the Shell lab, in which I asked for his help on clarifying on how the redirection sample source code, that was provided to us by Dr. Freudenthal, worked and provided me enough clarification so as to be able to produce the algorithm on my own, based on my understanding. I assisted him in simply providing him where the assignment requirements were located.
