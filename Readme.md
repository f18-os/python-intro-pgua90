Lab 1: Python Introduction


Project Description

The assignment consisted of the student to become introduced to use of Python and to become familiar with the using of it. The assignment consisted of creating a program that is able to read a file that possessed the contents of words.
After reading the contents of the file, each text were to be inserted into a new text output file, whilst excluding all text that were upper-cased and were non-alphabetic characters.
The assignment also instructed on keeping account of the number of occurrences for each word, as well as sorting the list of words.

Testing Description
Using the professor's source code as reference, I decided to use the part concerning the input of the text files, both input and output files. With this, what is used as a Dictionary, with the variable name "wordList", which would keep the list of words obtained from teh text file.
Used as well from the reference code, I had the file read, in the format of being read line by line and split between whitespaces. For each text found, text that excluded upper-cased text and removed non-alphabetic characters from the text found. An if-statement was created so as to count the number of occurrences of that text were to be found within the file, with a default number of 1, if occurrence of the text was only once. The list of words were then sorted and another file was created in order to store the newly added list of words, each with their respective number of occurrences.

Collaborated with: Sebastian Nunez, in we discussed the understanding on the logic of using Python.

Resources used:
* Used Dr. Freudenthal's source code as reference for my code.
* Used the following sites:
    * https://www.guru99.com/reading-and-writing-files-in-python.html#3 - (Site was used as reference and guidence in the implementation of reading and writing both input and output files respectively, of which I used a more efficient way to open the file so as to not worry about closing the file as well).
    * https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/index.htm - (Used site as an insight on the logic of Python and how to code with it, whilst using the visuals as practice and implementing some of the functions for Python in my code, such as the use of input and output of the files).
    * https://www.afterhoursprogramming.com/tutorial/python/python-overview/ - (This site simply provided more information and step-by-step processes as to what Python is and its logic, of which I used its resources to practice on coding in Python).
